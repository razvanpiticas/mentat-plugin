/**
 * Tells the user, at the start of a session, that a newer Mentat plugin has been published.
 *
 * Nothing we publish can switch a user's auto-update on — that setting lives in their own
 * `~/.claude/settings.json`, and neither the marketplace manifest nor the plugin has a field that
 * reaches it. So the plugin does the one thing it can do from inside their machine: notice, and
 * say so. Without this, a stale plugin is silent, and the first sign of it is a skill describing
 * tools the server does not have.
 *
 * <b>The check never runs in the foreground.</b> SessionStart delays the session until every hook
 * returns, and a network call on a bad connection would hold the prompt for as long as the timeout.
 * Instead this reads the answer the *previous* session left behind, says its piece immediately, and
 * spawns a detached process to refresh the file for next time. The cost of that is one session's
 * lag on the very first notice, which is worth paying to never delay a prompt.
 *
 * It speaks on two channels because they reach different readers:
 * - `systemMessage` is shown to the person. They are the one who decides to update.
 * - `additionalContext` is given to the model, so "update mentat" is understood without a search.
 *
 * Failures are swallowed on purpose, and this is the one place in this repository where that is
 * right: the hook runs before every session, it is not part of any result the user asked for, and
 * a plugin that prints a red error because a laptop was offline is worse than one that stays quiet.
 * A silent check reverts the session to how it behaved before this file existed.
