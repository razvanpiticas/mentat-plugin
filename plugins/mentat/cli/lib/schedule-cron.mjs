 * The crontab entry that fires a routine on macOS and Linux.

 * without owning the file. The person's other lines are read, kept and written back untouched:
 * a crontab is the machine's, not this product's, and a tool that rewrites it wholesale is a tool
 * that eats somebody's backup job the first time it is run.
 *
 * <p>The crontab itself is reached through an injected pair rather than called directly, so the
 * add, the refusal to add twice, the remove and the listing are all proved over a fake pair
 * instead of over the developer's own crontab.</p>
