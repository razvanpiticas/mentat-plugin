/**
 * `mentat schedule` — the half of switching a routine on that lives on this machine.
 *
 * <p>A routine is a row on the Mentat server: a name, a five-field cron line, the zone it is read
 * in, the agent it boots and the instructions written to that agent. <b>The server never fires
 * one.</b> This machine does, and only if an entry for it exists in a scheduler here. So switching a
 * routine on is two writes, and this command is the second: it installs one entry that starts the
 * harness non-interactively in the project's own directory with the boot prompt the skill composed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Three things it refuses rather than guesses, each because guessing produces a routine that
 * fires at a time nobody chose or does not fire at all: a harness with no verified way of running
 * one prompt on its own, a zone that is not this machine's, and a cron line the machine's own
 * scheduler cannot express.</p>
