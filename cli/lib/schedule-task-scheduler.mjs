/**
 * The Task Scheduler entries that fire a routine on Windows.
 *
 * <p><b>Task Scheduler takes no cron line.</b> It takes a frequency and one time of day, so a line
 * with two hours in it is two tasks, and a line it cannot express at all is refused rather than
 * approximated. An approximation here would fire a routine at an hour nobody chose and nobody could
 * see, which is worse than not installing it.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>And it takes no long command either.</b> `/TR` is capped at 261 characters — the refusal is
 * `ERROR: Value for '/TR' option cannot be more than 261 character(s)`, met live on 2026-09-21 — and
 * a project path plus the boot prompt plus the flags is comfortably past it. So the task runs a
 * small script this command writes, one per routine, and `/TR` carries only its path. The script is
 * where the directory change and the harness command live, and `remove` deletes it with the tasks.</p>
 *
 * <p>`schtasks` and the script file are both reached through injected ports, so the conversion, the
 * refusals, the removal and the listing are all proved without creating a task or writing a file on
 * the machine running the suite.</p>
